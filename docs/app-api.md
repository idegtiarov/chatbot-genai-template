# 📟 API application

The technologies used by the generated API application are:

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - a modern, high-performance, web framework for building APIs with Python.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - the application uses it as a database to store chats, messages, and other data.
- [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) - a PostgreSQL extension for storing vector embeddings and running similarity search. (if RAG was enabled during the project generation)
- [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) - an asynchronous SQL query builder and ORM for Python based on [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/).
- [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) - a lightweight database migration tool for usage with SQLAlchemy.
- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) - a data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/) - a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

The following tools are used to maintain the code quality:

- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) - a testing framework for Python.
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a code formatter.
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) - a utility/library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections.
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - a tool for style guide enforcement.
- [PyLint](https://www.pylint.org/) - a source code, bug, and quality checker.
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a static type checker (if it was enabled during the project generation).

---

The code of the generated Backend API application is located either at the root of the generated project directory (if you chose to generate a [API only project](./project-api.md) without Web UI) or in the `apps/api/` directory (if you chose to generate [API + Web UI project](./project-api-web.md)).

To see the list of CLI commands that can be executed from the API application directory, please refer to the [API application CLI](./app-api-cli.md) documentation.

To get more details about the API application structure and its source code, please refer to the [API application code guide](./app-api-code-guide.md) documentation.
